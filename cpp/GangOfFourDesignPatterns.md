## For Each Pattern (Video Script Structure)

1. Introduction (30 seconds)
   - Brief overview of the pattern
   - Real-world analogy

2. Problem Statement (1 minute)
   - Describe the problem the pattern solves
   - Show a simple code example illustrating the problem

3. Pattern Structure (2 minutes)
   - Explain the components of the pattern
   - UML diagram or simple illustration

4. Implementation in Modern C++ (3-4 minutes)
   - Show code examples using latest C++ features
   - Explain key parts of the implementation

5. Benefits and Trade-offs (1 minute)
   - Discuss advantages of using the pattern
   - Mention potential drawbacks or considerations

6. Variations and Alternative Approaches (1-2 minutes)
   - Describe any common variations of the pattern
   - Discuss alternative solutions if applicable

7. Practical Example (2-3 minutes)
   - Demonstrate the pattern in a real-world scenario
   - Use the USMC TDG context where applicable

8. Best Practices and Tips (1 minute)
   - Share guidelines for effective use of the pattern
   - Common pitfalls to avoid

9. Conclusion and Next Steps (30 seconds)
   - Recap key points
   - Suggest further reading or exercises

Total video length: 12-15 minutes per pattern

## Course Project
Throughout the course, students will work on implementing various design patterns within the context of the USMC Tactical Decision Game. This project will serve as a practical application of the patterns learned, demonstrating how they can be used in a real-world scenario.

## Additional Resources
- Modern C++ features relevant to each pattern
- Recommended tools: CLion, ReSharper C++
- Supplementary reading materials and online resources
