# ResourceManager Mixin:

Created a ResourceManager template class that encapsulates the common resource management functionality.
**It takes two template parameters:**
1. The resource type T and the DerivedClass type (this is the Curiously Recurring Template Pattern, or CRTP).
2. The useResource method handles the logic for using and tracking a generic resource.


## Unit Base Class:

The Unit class remains largely unchanged but now includes a getName method to allow the ResourceManager to access the unit's name.


## Specific Unit Classes (Marine, Medic, Engineer):

These classes now inherit from both Unit<T> and ResourceManager<T, ClassName>.
The resource-specific logic (ammo for Marine, medkits for Medic, tools for Engineer) is now handled by the ResourceManager.
The action method in each class simply calls useResource().


## Benefits of this Approach:

**Reduced Code Duplication:** The resource management logic is now in one place, eliminating repetition across classes.
**Flexibility:** It's easy to add new types of units with different resources (as demonstrated by the Engineer class).
**Type Safety:** The use of templates maintains type consistency for resource amounts.
**Extensibility:** New resource-related functionality can be added to the ResourceManager and automatically be available to all units.


## CRTP Usage:

The use of CRTP (ResourceManager<T, DerivedClass>) allows the ResourceManager to access methods of the derived class (like getName()).
This enables the ResourceManager to be generic while still being able to output unit-specific information.


## Main Function:

The main function demonstrates how different unit types can be used polymorphically, each with its own resource type.

## Conclusion

This refactored version maintains all the benefits of the template-based approach, while significantly reducing code duplication and improving maintainability. It provides a flexible framework for adding new unit types with different resources, all while keeping the resource management logic centralized and reusable.
