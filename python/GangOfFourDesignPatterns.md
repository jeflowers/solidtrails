2. Pythonic Principles and Their Relation to Design Patterns
   - Duck typing and EAFP (Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission)
   - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
   - SOLID principles in Python context

### Module 2: Creational Design Patterns

3. Factory Method Pattern
4. Abstract Factory Pattern
5. Builder Pattern
6. Prototype Pattern
7. Singleton Pattern (and why it's often unnecessary in Python)

### Module 3: Structural Design Patterns

8. Adapter Pattern
9. Bridge Pattern
10. Composite Pattern
11. Decorator Pattern (including Python's built-in decorators)
12. Fa√ßade Pattern
13. Flyweight Pattern
14. Proxy Pattern

### Module 4: Behavioral Design Patterns

15. Chain of Responsibility Pattern

19. Mediator Pattern
20. Memento Pattern
21. Observer Pattern
22. State Pattern
23. Strategy Pattern
24. Template Method Pattern
25. Visitor Pattern

### Module 5: Practical Application - USMC Tactical Decision Game

26. Applying Design Patterns to a Real-world Scenario
    - Overview of the USMC TDG scenario
    - Identifying applicable design patterns
    - Implementing patterns in the context of the game using Python

## For Each Pattern (Video Script Structure)

1. Introduction (30 seconds)
   - Brief overview of the pattern
   - Real-world analogy

2. Problem Statement (1 minute)
   - Describe the problem the pattern solves
   - Show a simple Python code example illustrating the problem

3. Pattern Structure (2 minutes)
   - Explain the components of the pattern
   - UML diagram or simple illustration

4. Pythonic Implementation (3-4 minutes)
   - Show code examples using Python-specific features
   - Explain key parts of the implementation
   - Discuss how Python's features influence the pattern implementation

5. Benefits and Trade-offs (1 minute)
   - Discuss advantages of using the pattern in Python
   - Mention potential drawbacks or considerations

6. Variations and Alternative Approaches (1-2 minutes)
   - Describe any common variations of the pattern in Python
   - Discuss alternative Pythonic solutions if applicable

7. Practical Example (2-3 minutes)
   - Demonstrate the pattern in a real-world scenario
   - Use the USMC TDG context where applicable

8. Best Practices and Tips (1 minute)
   - Share guidelines for effective use of the pattern in Python
   - Common pitfalls to avoid

9. Conclusion and Next Steps (30 seconds)
   - Recap key points
   - Suggest further reading or exercises

Total video length: 12-15 minutes per pattern

## Course Project
Throughout the course, students will work on implementing various design patterns within the context of the USMC Tactical Decision Game using Python. This project will serve as a practical application of the patterns learned, demonstrating how they can be used in a real-world scenario.

## Additional Resources
- Modern Python features relevant to each pattern (e.g., dataclasses, type hints)
- Recommended tools: PyCharm, Visual Studio Code with Python extensions
- Supplementary reading materials and online resources
- Python-specific design pattern variations and idioms
